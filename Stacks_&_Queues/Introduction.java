INTRODUCTIONS:-

Stacks and queues are two fundamental data structures used in computer science for organizing and managing data. They have distinct characteristics and are used in different scenarios.

Stacks:
Definition:
A stack is a collection of elements with two main operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element.

Time Complexity:

Push Operation: O(1) - Constant time, as it involves adding an element to the top of the stack.
Pop Operation: O(1) - Constant time, as it involves removing the top element from the stack.
Space Complexity:
The space complexity of a stack is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack.

Queues:
Definition:
A queue is a collection of elements with two main operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the back of the queue, and dequeue, which removes the element from the front of the queue.

Time Complexity:

Enqueue Operation: O(1) - Constant time, as it involves adding an element to the back of the queue.
Dequeue Operation: O(1) - Constant time, as it involves removing the front element from the queue.
Space Complexity:
The space complexity of a queue is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue.
